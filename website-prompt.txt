You are a coding assistant. I have a website with a contact form and JavaScript (script.js) that handles form submission. Currently, the page has two main issues:

An invalid email validation regex causing this console error:

Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /^(([^<>()[\\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\\[[0-9]{1,3}\\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\])|(([a-zA-Z\\-0-9]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/: Range out of order in character class


Fix this by replacing it with a safe and simple regex.

The console shows a 404 error for /favicon.ico. Add a <link> in the HTML <head> referencing /favicon.ico.

Requirements for the updated script.js:

Use the simplified safe email regex: /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/

Keep all existing contact form logic, including form validation, sending data via fetch to the Cloudflare Worker, showing success/error messages.

Add console logs for debugging at key points: script loaded, DOM loaded, form found, form submitted, fetch response.

Ensure the page does not reload on form submission.

Do not change any other site functionality (hamburger menu, header resizing).

Deliverables:

Full updated script.js with fixes applied.
