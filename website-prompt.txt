Please review and fix the contact form functionality on the website. Follow these instructions carefully:

Verify the form submission listener

Ensure the submit listener is attached to the correct form (id="contact-form").

Ensure the submit button is inside the form with type="submit".

Confirm event.preventDefault() is used so the page does not jump when submitting.

Validate the form

Keep the existing validation for name, email, and message.

Make sure invalid inputs prevent the fetch request from being sent.

Ensure error messages appear correctly under each field.

Send request to Cloudflare Worker

The form should send a POST request to https://contact-relay.matthew-wetton1.workers.dev/ with the JSON payload.

Confirm the fetch is triggered correctly when inputs are valid.

Handle response and messages

If submission is successful, display a success message on the same page without scrolling or jumping.

If submission fails, show an error message without reloading the page.

Optional debugging

Temporarily log "Submit handler triggered" at the start of the submit listener to confirm it runs.

Log the payload being sent to the worker.

Ensure proper CORS handling

Confirm that the worker URL is reachable from the browser fetch and that no browser errors prevent the request from being sent.

Output

Provide the updated JS code for the contact form that addresses all the above points.

Only change whatâ€™s necessary to fix the submission, validation, and message display.

Keep the rest of the header, nav, and logo scrolling JS unchanged.
