You are tasked with updating the “Contact Us” form on a website. Follow these instructions carefully:

Attach JavaScript correctly

Ensure the JS executes after the DOM is fully loaded. Use either defer on the <script> tag or wrap all code in DOMContentLoaded event.

Make sure the contact form element is correctly selected and the submit listener attaches reliably.

Prevent default form submission

On form submit, use event.preventDefault() to stop the page from reloading or jumping to the top.

Ensure this triggers before any other errors can stop the JS from running.

Send form data to Cloudflare Worker

Submit the form via fetch() to:
https://contact-relay.matthew-wetton1.workers.dev/

Use POST method with Content-Type: application/json

Serialize the form data as JSON with JSON.stringify()

Add console logs for debugging

Log the contact form element, the form submission, and the data being sent.

Log the response from the Worker and any fetch errors.

Display success or error messages

On success ({success: true} from Worker), display a success message without reloading the page.

On error, display a clear error message.

Validate inputs before sending

Name, email, and message fields are required.

Ensure the email is valid with a regex check.

Show inline error messages next to invalid fields.

Do not change HTML structure unnecessarily

Only modify the JS for functionality, debugging, and validation.

Output instructions:

Provide updated script.js code that implements all of the above.

Include comments explaining the key changes.

Ensure that after submitting the form with valid inputs, the page does not reload, console logs show the request and response, and the Cloudflare Worker receives the data.
