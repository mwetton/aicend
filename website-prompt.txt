You are helping rebuild a "Contact Us" form from scratch. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Ensure the form is fully functional:
   - When submitted, the form sends a JSON POST request to this URL: https://contact-relay.matthew-wetton1.workers.dev/
   - Include the fields: name, email, message.
   - Do not redirect or reload the page on submit; show a success or error message inline.

2. Add proper client-side validation:
   - Name and message are required.
   - Email is required and must be a valid email format.
   - If validation fails, show error messages below each field in `.error-message` divs.

3. Debugging/logging:
   - Add console logs at the top of the script to confirm it loads.
   - Log when the DOM is ready.
   - Log form submission attempts and the JSON being sent.
   - Log fetch success or failure and the Workerâ€™s response.

4. Ensure the submit listener actually attaches:
   - Check that the element `#contact-form` exists before adding the listener.
   - Use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent default page reload.

5. Make it resilient:
   - Display success message "Your message has been sent!" inline when Worker responds with success.
   - Display error message "An error occurred. Please try again." inline if Worker responds with error or fetch fails.
   - Keep the page in place; do not jump to the top.

6. Wrap the fetch in `async/await` with try/catch.
7. Keep the rest of the site functionality (hamburger menu, header resizing) intact.
8. Ensure script can be included with `<script defer src="script.js"></script>` or placed before `</body>` and still work.
9. Output the full `script.js` ready to replace the existing one.
